# To Do list

## **Generate** figures
    [] bodefig: generate level code for nice bode plots
    [] pzfig: pole-zero map figure (see Ohnishi-san code)
    [] magfig: code to magnify on figure

## **Publish** figures
    [] flex legend: more options to legend styles
    [] align subplot axis
    [] add property fig position
    [] make Tick property changing X,Y,Z simultaniously
    [] pubfig is too long; exploid it into parent/children
       analyze matlab inherence and build a simpler version

       In essence; this is a wrapper for the matlab figure class
       closely mimique it, but simplify steps/notation/loops
## **Export** figures
    [] solve high-dpi screen exporting
    [] seperate
